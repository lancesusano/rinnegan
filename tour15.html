<h1> Washing Machine </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really did not recognize the necessity of having a washing machine inside the unit
solely because I never used it. My outlook towards the subject, however, changed when my friends and I experienced a scarcity in clothes days before my 18th birthday. We literally stayed in the unit for three days 
using only three sets of clothes - which, of course, obliged us to wash our clothes outside our own free will. Initially, the plan was for them to stay for the night, and for the night alone. But my friend, Shannon, suggested: <em>"Stay kami hanggang birthday mo ah."</em> which was two days more. I was overwhelmed by the statement and immediately 
answered <em>"Sure."</em> without regards to our food, clothes, and money. I immediately called my mom to which she approved. But on the latter, she added: <em>"Pano food niyo? Gusto mo ipadaan ko yung mga shirt mo kay tito mo?"</em> 
But what is a group of boys without conformity to the similar agony? As a result, I politely denied my mother's request. And believe it or not, we survived the imminent days that came with the same pattern of behavior - wearing clothes, cleaning them, and letting them dry over the afternoon. </p>
