<h1> Door </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I couldn't think of any description to allocate to this door; So, perhaps a funny story would do. It was two days before my birthday when four of my friends decided 
to stay with me for the weekend. After eating breakfast, we decided to bring the fun in the swimming pool. One of my friends, named Jom, was quite persistent in persuading us to stay in the room. 
I know! You're probably thinking, <em> Who wouldn't want to go for a swim in an extremely hot day? </em> Well, a person who couldn't swim, of course! Regardless of the promising words, we proceeded to the swimming pool, leaving Jom inside the room. 
In the middle of stroking, the clouds started to pour and it immediately grew cold. We knew that we couldn't last a little longer. We hastily went back to the unit where a locked door was the first to welcome us. We knocked for about five times or more, and the only response that we got was a laugh from the inside.
Touché, Jomark. Touché.  </p>
