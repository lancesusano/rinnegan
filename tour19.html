<h1> Window </h1>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the windows situated in the living room, the windows inside the bedroom
also plays a major role in determining the ambiance of the room through the curtains that are attached onto it. The windows are only fun in the presence of the sun, I wish I could assert the same statement during its absence.
The things is, I never understood people who sleeps with their windows exposed!  Whenever I'm inside the bedroom, I always see to it that the windows are fully covered by the curtains. I just couldn't bare the possibility of seeing unwanted mystical creatures lurking in the night.
Initially, I though it was just me who mustered a peculiar outlook on windows. My friends, who stayed in the condominium days before my birthday, redefined the afore-mentioned statement by demonstrating the similar behavior towards the subject. I was so glad to know that I wasn't the only one!   </p>
