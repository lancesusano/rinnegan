<h1> Who am I? </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hi guys! It's me, the same person found in the 'home' section of this webpage.
To be frank, I'd be surprise just as much as you are if I were to step on your shoe. The weight-shift was, according to them, patently colossal that I often receive set of words like: <em> "Huy parang tumaba ka ata? </em> and
<em> "Diet-diet din kapag may time!" </em>. In all honesty, such words do not bother me. Least I can look at myself in the mirror and say - <em> "Man, am I proud of myself." </em>
<br>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is <strong> Rafael Lance Q. Budomo</strong>, a sophisticated 18-year-old boy who is fond of writing songs and poems, collecting shoes, taking aesthetically pleasing photographs, and listening to indie music.
My name, on a larger scale, means <em> <strong> The Warrior of God </em> </strong> with Lance as a pole weapon or spear designed to be used by a mounted warrior or cavalry soldier; and Rafael derived from the benevolent Archangel Raphael
of Judaism Christianity.  I stand by the principle - <em> Treat everyone fairly and rightfully, no matter how much they do you wrong. Be an egalitarian, but be forgiving as well. </em> I am a very jolly person with a comedic nature that often troubles me dearly! 
For the most part, it's always my friends complaining how much they couldn't breathe whenever I'm around. Although I couldn't stand silence just as much as I couldn't stand noise, laughter is nothing but music to my ears. And the harmony is fulfilling when you know it came from you!

<h1> My Family </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come from a loving family of four with me being the eldest. Both of my parents met in Santa Catalina College as highschool students.
My mother was a conservative Filipina who studied in her free time, performed in various extracurricular activities, and was an active member of the school's council. My father, on the other side of the bronx, showed little to no regard to 
educational activities and social constructs - yet continued to excel in the field of academics. In their differences, who would have thought that they'd be the ones who'd end up together. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, allow me to provide you the story. When they were about to graduate highschool, my Dad decided to join the school's choir, where my
 mother was the active president. Since my father was the type who was overwheled by his youth, his inability to take matters of the like seriously is something my mother couldn't tolerate.
 Of course, graduation came and both of them demonstrated enthusiasm upon leaving. But the unexpected occured, and it occured in the most unusual time.
 While apart from one another, my father recognized that hole that rose from leaving the campus. Initially unconscious of the causation, he kept on pondering recent events that will ignite a spark in him. 
 None of which did, until he fathomed his memories with my mother. During the time when Facebook and Yahoo-Mail weren't established yet, nor was any social networking sites, my Father proceeded to what we Filipinos know as the <em> Mano-mano </em> method. 
 He asked for her, he searched for her, and ALAS! he found her. The ever-so-famous rivalry was watered by love and surfaced in Matrimony - leaving all of their batchmates with two words: <em>"Who knew?" </em>

<h1> My Brother </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this picture lies my partner in crime; my brother, Richard Lemuel Q. Budomo. From this point on you'd probably notice
that our first two names start with the letter 'R' followed by the letter 'L'. The reason behind this is because my father's name is Rovero and my mother's name is Ludeth. 
Jumping back to the topic, my brother and I basically did all the things we could ever think of together during our younger years. The bond that lied between the two of us was built by bricks of similarities - 
and for the most part, we never saw the fun in doing what we're told. We often ventured through restricted areas, skipped afternoon naptimes, wrestled in beds, and secretly played pass our curfew time. I also lost a tooth when I was younger because of him. 
I cried because of the pain, he laughed because of the way I cried; that, of course, curved my frown upside-down. The age gap between the two of us isn't quite patent; I'm only older for about a year and four months. 
The height gap, however, is a completely different story! I'm currently towering over about 5 feet and 9 inches. My brother, on the other side of the bronx, is currently towering over about 6 feet and 2 inches.
I know right! It hurts to be the older brother in a situation like this. But hey! I'm happy for my brother. He means the world to me, and I'm glad that he received the better side of our genetic composition.

<h1> My Earlier Days </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My childhood days were an amalgamation of the Philippines, California, and New Jersey. 
When I was younger, I had this stuffed-toy of a pug that I named doggy-dog. He was a friend who helped me battle anxiety throughout middle school for about a couple of years. When I heard the news that we were going to New Jersey to attend my Auntie Liezel's wedding, 
I immediately packed him inside my bag and as I fathomed our imminent possible adventures together. We didn't directly land in New Jersey, we stayed in a hotel in San Francisco for about two days (Thus the picture of me near the Golden gate bridge). 
Third day arrived and it was time for us to leave, but I wasn't ready yet solely because I couldn't find doggy-dog inside my bag. The entire family looked for him for about an hour, but he just wasn't there! My mother insisted that if we stayed a little longer, then we might not make it in the wedding. 
Trust me when I tell you this - I have never cried as much as I did during that time.

<h1> My Highschool Days </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I was only known for two things when I was in highschool: (1) The person who had such little regards in the field of academics - not underperforming, not overdelivering;
 and (2) The poetic gladiator. When I was in sophomore year, I was arguing with my friend about a social norm that others would rather have undefiled. Since the norm was widely practiced during the time being, to desire to change the social construct
is to imply that you're siding with the social activists; groups of individuals most of the people from my school abhorred. The loathing, as I believe, has a causal relationship with their placement in the socio-economic plane in the Philippines - considering the fact that most of them are members of the upper class. 
The risk did not matter to me; I mean, <strong> what do I care </strong>. I wanted enlightenment in the form of a prosperous debate, and I refuse to settle for the usual, when the usual is literally a low-level of magnitude away from crumbling. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A person of the name Eugene was listening to our parley, without us knowing, of course. He told us that if we wanted to have more of this discourse then we might as well join the Debate Team; and so we did. Immediately after, we qualified for the Southern Luzon Interschool Debate in UP Los Banos. 
With I as the first speaker and the captain of the team, and my friend (the guy wearing the blue shirt) as the second speaker of the team. The preliminary round of the said tournament passed with ease, we ended the day with the score of 3 wins and a lost. We won against La Salle twice, and U.P once; but unfortunately lost to Ateneo within a margin of 0.1.
It was a close fight, and with close fights come questionable decisions. My friend demonstrated dislike to how Ateneo won the debate; moreover, he showcased quite a distaste to the afore-mentioned school. What's ironic in all of this is that he's currently studying in Ateneo as we speak.

<h1> Friends that turned into Family </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Allow me to introduce them one by one, using the left to right fashion: Jomark, JD, Shannon, Ariel, and I. The photo was taken inside my unit during the night before my birthday. 
After taking the photo, we immediately went out to attend the evening sunday mass; afterwards grabbed japanese food with my parents. My friends and I met in De La Salle University – Dasmariñas way back in 2015, as freshmen students of the block BSY14. 
It did not take us awhile to form a brotherly relationship among each other. As time progressed, our reputation followed. Everybody else regarded us as the <em> Wolfpack </em> or simply the pack during our earlier college days. 
Although not quite fond of our group name due to the fact that it makes us sound like a really edgy rockband, I've learned to accept it wholeheartedly without questions simply because my love for them weighs more than my love for self-image. 
Unfortunately, due to the surfacing individual life problems that my friends have encountered, they were forced to work at an earlier age to perpetuate their survival and the survival of their families. I would delve into the topic deeper, but I feel like I'm not in the position to reveal such confidentiality.
The stigma that accompanies every single one of them is truly unpleasant, troubling me gravely. Everybody else thinks they're far too lazy, unorganized, and unsettled to prioritize their academe. But little did they know that education, to my friends, is  an arsenal that inevitably slept away from their possession. As Ariel said, <em>"Pare, gusto ko talaga mag aral. Kung hindi lang talaga sa'kin ipinagdamot eh."</em> 
Why is it so hard to understand that these issues are not generated by voluntary imposition? But are caused by natural disasters imposed by the larger cosmos. Presently, due to the uncontrollable nature of their issues, the only ideas with which they cling into are the following: faith, prayers, and trust in God.  
<br> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Massive love to my friends: Jomark Sardana, Shannon Bayot, Jaydee Dumag, and Ariel Cristobal for making my college days a little better. In their absence, I feel incomplete; but with their persistent
regards, the gap is filled. They never forget to drop by the university every now and then to check on me, to make sure that everything is falling into place. There was this one time when I told them stories about my academic struggles in which they replied in a form of a comedic conversation: "<em> Panay ka aral eh, pag ikaw nagkasakit!</em>" As a reply, my other friend lamented: <em>"Pag nagkasakit yan pare, hindi na sa St. Luke's yan dadalhin, diretso na yan sa St. Peter" In this exchange of words, I've realized that maybe it's true that I'm outworking myself to the extent of damaging my physical health. 
The care that I receive from them is truly surreal, and with that I'm utmost blessed.
