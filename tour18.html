<h1> Bed </h1>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of my time in the unit is spent laying in bed. My daily travel hours from school to home lies roughly between 2 to 3 hours.
Unfortunately, there are days where I feel nothing but tiredness; where my eyes are few more blinks left from shutting, and my body is a few more cusion deeper from resting. Whenever days of the like arrives, waiting for about two more hours or so before reaching home might not 
be the logical alternative - considering the possible threat of falling asleep upon commuting (an event that has recurred constantly, to me, when I was in sophomore year). So, instead of traveling for about 2 hours or more, I commit myself to a travel that lasts for about an hour less by 
taking the route that would lead me to the condominium. I wouldn't say I lost more in this context, considering the fact that it also takes an hour from the condominium to reach home.
