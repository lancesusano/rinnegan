<h1> The Crucifix </h1>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My family is the perfect example of an Orthodoxic Catholic Family. Every section of the unit, as well as our proper home, 
has religious paraphernalia scattered across every corner. According to research, the primary purpose of religious paraphernalia is to remind the person of the teachings, doctrines, and proper moral conduct as lamented
by their respective religious group. Since majority of the social norms do not conform with the teachings of the church, perhaps the placement of such paraphernalia is meant to restrict whoever is in the unit from committing such immoral acts.
If this is the case, then I'd be the first to call it effective.  I'm truly glad that they are there to remind me of my individuality as a Christian; obliged to resist temptations and fight surrounding societal wrongdoings.   </font>
